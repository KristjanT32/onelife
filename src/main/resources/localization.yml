# This is the language information file for ${project.name} ${project.version}

# This is the list of languages that the plugin supports. If you'd like to add your own,
# create your own localization file by copying the main language file (en-US.yml),
# translating it to whatever language you'd like and renaming it to [languageCode].yml
# Please do not forget to add the language code to the list below, for the plugin to
# know you've added a translation.
